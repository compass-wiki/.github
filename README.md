# Compass 🧭
Compass is a company dedicated to bringing the future of staff documentation to the platform. Compass features unique features to properly showcase and represent your documentation. Compass believes that all communities, no matter how big or small, should have access to be able to correctly secure their documentation.

## How can Compass help my community? 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
Within the Emergency Response: Liberty County community, leaked staff documentation and procedures is a common thing. Sometimes it's a fired staff member taking revenge, or an accidental leak of the documentation link while streaming, or even a retired staff member copying your documentation. This is where Compass comes in, Compass is not only a way to add an extra layer of protection to your staff documentation, but also a way to more customize your documentation to your server.

Compass offers a number of things for any community, including protection, customization, privacy, and friendly customer support for your documentation.

## How do I use Compass? 🧑🏻‍💻
Compass documentation is a monthly paid subscription, the money from subscriptions is used to pay developers, maintain and power Compass services, and improve Compass services. We aim to keep prices cheap, but fair, prices are set at the market value and exceptions do apply under very rare circumstances.

At the moment, due to us only starting development a few days ago, a dashboard will not be available on release. To edit and upload pages, you will be given a channel in our Support Server for us to manually change it for you. For easier access, we are able to import your old staff documentation, and all pages are written in Markdown. Meaning all you need to do is send us the markdown file and we will upload it to our servers.

## What does Compass offer? 💳
- Discord Authentication
  - Allows you to lock your staff documentation behind a staff role, meaning only users with that staff role can access it
- Customization
  - Edit and customize the site however you want, major changes may be subject to further costs depending on the changes
  - Up to 50 custom pages, which are all written in Markdown for ease of access
- Domains
  - Ability to use one of our own subdomains or bring your own custom domain
- Early Access
  - As Compass is still in Beta, a lot more updates are to come, subscribers get early access to new content
 
## How much does Compass cost? 💵
Compass is a monthly subscription, which costs 1,200 Robux per month. This is to cover costs to host, maintain and manage your documentation. Private Beta may be unstable and features may not be present at this time, currently, Compass does not offer an in-app editor. Meaning that you have to send us what you want to add, change or remove, and we will do it for you.

Though, do not worry about the wait, it only takes us a few clicks to edit your documentation; so it isn't a huge problem there. By purchasing Private Beta, you will be given either a channel in this server, or a groupchat to communicate with us, whether it is asking for something to be changed, reporting bugs, or giving feedback on Compass.

### We have limited spots for Private Beta release, meaning that not everyone may get in.
